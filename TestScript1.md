Prologue, Scene 1

-Before the Concert

#[mc is seated on a bench in the city’s largest park, gazing into the darkening sky]

mc "(Some kind of profound monologue regarding his current view of the world, idfk.)"

mc  "(I was so lost in thought that I hadn’t noticed how long I had been sitting here, waiting.)"

#[A can of chilled soda appears as the text is read]

mc  "(It was only when I had felt the touch of an ice cold object pressed against the nape of my neck that I realized I had been daydreaming.)"

#[Silhouette of Brandon’s sprite appears, as screen shakes to signify mc jolting up]

mc  "?!"

bra "Oh, hey, you are awake."

#[Pulling out his phone to see the time was now 6:34 PM]

mc  "Yeah, I am. You’re cutting it close. What took you so long?" #[Slightly annoyed tone]

#[Brandon’s silhouette fully becomes the character’s sprite]

bra "Missed the damn train because I had to make a stop. Got us some drinks and snacks, see?" #[Lifts up a convenience store bag full of items]

"(The person that had just risen me from my stupor was my close friend, Brandon Marsh. We’ve known each other since we were kids, but we didn’t really grow up together.)"

"(I only ever saw him when I would visit my grandparents here in the city, since his house was just down the road. You could probably tell from his mannerisms and appearance, but he’s not from Japan.)"

"(He tells me that when he was 2 years old, his parents were so fascinated by the country that they moved here, though that wasn’t without some issues.)"

"(Because of this, he was raised by both the Japanese school system and the American mannerisms that his parents carried over from their last residence. The first time I met him, I was 5 years old, and we've become good friends since.)"

#[Standing up from the bench]

mc  "I guess that saves us some money, then. C’mon, the show starts at 7, and we still have to get through the line at security"

bra "Shit, you’re right. Yeah, let’s hurry"

#[mc and Brandon begin walking further through the park to the concert venue, which is a stage set up near the center of the grass]

bra "So what made you a fan of this Scarlett girl? I didn’t think you were the type to follow anything idol related."

mc  "Well, sometime before I moved here, I was scrolling through a bunch of channels. One of them was this broadcast showcasing a bunch of up-and-coming artists. Most of them didn’t really stand out to me. Felt like they were all part of this blur"

#[Looking to the side at mc]

bra "But she did, huh?"

mc  "Yeah… I don’t know what it was about her."

#[mc begins to look up to the sky, in which the sun had already set]

mc  "She just felt so vibrant, you know? Singing those songs all while dancing with a smile. It all just felt… cool, I guess. I don’t know, she just feels right to me, like she just knew how to pique my fancy"

#[Camera cuts back to scene]

bra "And that’s why you wanted to go to the first concert available, to see your new favorite idol live?"

mc  "Yeah, you caught me" #[Mockingly defeated tone]

bra "I thought that was the case. Because I thought you’d wanna see more of Scarlett tonight…"

#[Brandon pulls out 2 tickets from his hoodie pockets, and hands one to mc]

bra "...I got us these"

mc  "No way!"

mc  "Are those the deluxe tickets that sold out weeks ago?!"

bra "Sure are"

mc  "Don’t these cost quite a bit? I’ll pay you back later, when I can"

#[Waving his hand in front of him dismissively]

bra "Nah, don’t sweat it. Just think of this as a welcome gift from me."

mc  "Oh, well, thanks dude. This is actually a really nice thing of you to do for once"

bra "Like I’m ever not nice" #[Sarcastically]

mc  "Well, it’s a good thing you told me now, because there’s a second line for special ticket holders to go right through"

#[mc points at a shorter, much faster line into the venue with a sign that reads "deluxe patrons only"]

bra "I knew I made the right call to make that stop"

mc  "What was that?" #[Quizzically]

bra "Nothing, let’s head in"

"(The wait had just barely reached the 5 minute mark when we got cleared to enter. It was now 6:50, ten minutes until showtime. And the other line looked like it wouldn’t be fully cleared until after the show had already started.)"

mc "(Thanks again Brandon)"

#[Scene transitions to the concert]

"(The crowd was unlike anything I had seen before. At least a thousand or two strangers crammed into this small section of the park. There was no ceiling, so you could look up and see the night sky.)"

"(The stage spotlights were currently aimed at the crowd as one of the sole sources of light for the crowd to see and navigate with. But thanks to our nearly late arrival, Brandon and I were stuck near the rear middle, a good 15 rows away from the stage.)"

"(But I could thankfully still see the stage clearly, the sea of heads indicative of just how popular Scarlett must be. Before long, the voice of a hypeman roars through the speakers.)"

"Hypeman" "Alright, you precious little Roses. You’ve been waiting long enough. Give some cheer to your darling senpai, Scarlett!"

#[The crowd begins counting down with the hypeman]

"Hypeman" "In 5... 4... 3... 2... 1..."

#"(When the countdown had reached zero, all the lights in the area had shut off. In this period of pitch black respite, a wave of glow sticks from raving fans had emerged, dimly illuminating the restless and excited crowd.)"

#"(When the stage lighting had reactivated, there stood Scarlett, who opened up her performance with her iconic line)"

sca "Heeeeyyyy, everyone~"

#[Sounds of the roaring crowd following this opening line]

sca "How are my lovely little Roses doing on this fine evening? I hope you’re prepared to get pumped up, because the show starts now!"

"(The instrumental of her latest single began to play, as the crowd cheered Scarlett on.)"

"(The vibrant flashing lights, in conjunction with Scarlett’s stellar singing and captivating rhythmic dances, had created a vivid image that could never be achieved by just viewing a televised broadcast.)"

"(This was here. This was now. This was Scarlett’s magic spell in action. I stood there in awe, unable to even cheer myself with just how incredible this spectacle was.)"

"(At least an hour had gone by with this routine keeping my attention in this tunnel visioned daydream. Before I realized, the performance had come to an end and I was left wanting for more.)"

"(The sounds of encore raging throughout the park awoke me, along with an announcement from Scarlett herself)"

sca "This isn’t the end yet, Roses. You dedicated fans already know that just after this, there will be a meet and greet Q&A panel, where you can request any question of your darling senpai, at the adjacent tent. See you there, lovelies."

#[Scarlett then walks towards the backstage, vanishing behind the curtains]

mc  "(Seemingly reading my mind, I felt Brandon tap my shoulder, speaking to me.)"

bra "That’s us, get your ticket ready"

mc  "Yeah, I have it here. We should head over"

#[mc and Brandon begin to walk over to the exit and towards the neighboring tent]
