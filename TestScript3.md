Prologue, Scene 3

-After? the Concert

#[Connor and Brandon exit the concert tent and begin walking towards the end of the line full of deluxe ticket holders, waiting to enter the tent where the Q&A panel would be held]

bra "So what’d you think? Worth the price of the tickets?"

mc  "Yeah, definitely. I’ll be going to the next concert if I find the time. You wanna tag along?"

bra "Sure, I’m down with that."

#[Brandon notices that he has to use the restroom]

bra "Hey, go ahead and get in line without me. Gotta use the restroom real quick."

mc  "Oh, alright. Get back here quick, though. I don’t wanna be in this line alone for too long."

#[Brandon begins heading away from the line, while Connor moves towards it]

#[Connor gazes at how long the line has formed]

mc  "No wonder those tickets sold ou-"

#[Geisha’s silhouette appears, screen shakes]

geiq "He…GYA-!"

mc  "(Since I was distracted by my own thoughts, I didn’t notice that I was about to crash into someone else. I heard her cry out slightly before we were both sent to the ground from our collision)"

#[Scene switches to image of Connor helping Geisha back on her feet]

mc  "Hey, you ok? I wasn’t looking ahead."

geiq "Sorry! My bad, shoulda been, like, watching where I was going…"

mc  "(Oh god, not this trend…)"

mc  "That’s good. Here, lemme help you up."

#[Scene changes to previous backdrop, but Geisha’s sprite is fully visible now]

geiq "Yeah, thanks. Sorry, if I'm, like, making you late somewhere."

mc  "No, it’s fine. I’m just about to get in the line here."

geiq "You’re here for the panel? Like, no way! How did you even manage to buy the tickets? They sold out in, like, 30 seconds."

mc  "Oh, that was thanks to my friend. I don't know where he got them, but we came here together."

geiq "Tsk… fuckin’ lucky…"

mc  "What, did you not manage to get them?"

geiq "No… just barely had enough to, like, get the basic one…"

mc  "Well, that’s too bad, I gue-"

#[Nekome’s sprite rushes into the scene, out of breath]

nekq "Kiriiiin~! Wait up~!"

mc  "(Kirin…?)"

krn "Oh hii~, Nyeko-chan. What’s up?"

nyk "Why’d you run off like that?"

#[Pouty-like]

krn "I just felt like getting out of here, ya know?"

nyk "But Kirin, Atsuko managed to, like, upgrade our tickets. I wanted to tell you, but you, like, ran off and stuff."

#[Excitedly]

krn "She did? Like, how??"

nyk "I don't know, but she told me to come get you and bring you back."

krn "Like, where is she then?!"

nyk "She should be near the front now, so we should like-"

#[Geisha’s sprite rushes off (with a sound like they use in cartoons, you know the kind)]

nyk "Heyy~! Don’t do that~"

#[Nekome turns to Connor, giving him a quick silent glance, before her sprites also rushes off, but slower than Geisha]

mc  "(Wonder what her deal is. Still, glad that girl’s problem got solved.)"

#[Connor begins walking to the end of the line, and starts waiting his turn. Brandon soon returns]

bra "Yo, I miss anything?"

mc  "Nah, you’re fine. Just ran into this group of gals. Nothing really happened though."

bra "Ok, then. Let’s get in there."

mc  "(Kirin, huh? I think I know that name. I’ll have to check if it really was them…)"

#[The scene transitions into the tent]

mc  "(Brandon and I take our seats. I can’t get a good look to see where that Kirin girl and her friends are, but that’s fine.)"

#[Scarlett’s sprite appears]

mc  "(The panel began, but the questions were lackluster for the most part, usually just about Scarlett’s sizes, her address… things she would never even want to answer. It continued like this until a reporter stood up and posed a rather odd question that received an even more outstanding answer.)"

"Reporter" "Rumor has it that you’re still in highschool, Ms. Scarlett, but you’re set to graduate this year. Is this a claim that you can confirm, and what would it mean for your career going forward?"

#[Scarlett’s sprite takes on somewhat of a strained smile]

sca "Oh, wow~! You must know your stuff, huh…?"

#[Sprite returns to normal]

sca "Well, I’ll have you know that I definitely have big plans coming up by the end of the year. Because, and you heard this here first, my little roses, I’m planning on taking on the idol industry in Japan by storm, and rising to the top!"

#[The crowd cheers]

sca "And not only that, when I’m done with Japan, I’m going after the world itself! I hope you’ll be there to support your darling Senpai."

#[Scarlett’s sprite puts on a cute face]

sca "Won’t you?"

#[Crowd cheers even louder than before]

mc  "(She’s really planning on doing all that? Well, damn, I’ll be on that wild ride too.)"

mc  "(...but wait, what about the first part? She didn’t outright deny it. It’s more like she… tried to avoid it. Whatever the case, I’ll try my best to show her my support.)"

#[Scene fades to black]

mc  "(The panel continued on with nothing else special happening. After a series of answered questions, Scarlett thanked everyone for coming, and she retired backstage while the crowd dispersed towards the exit. After we left the venue, Brandon and I walked back to the train station. On the train, I told Brandon what I thought of her avoiding the question, and he replied that it’s just her business and she doesn’t have to tell anybody. After we got off the train, we walked down to our houses, said our good nights, and turned in for some sleep.)"
