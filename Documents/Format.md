# Format 

This is the guide the writers are working with:

name "dialogue"
having a consistent name before each character's lines and using "quote marks" makes it so SO much easier to convert to code.

For narration don't use a name but keep the speech marks
"narration"

For internal dialogue/thoughts add (brackets):
name "(thoughts)"

For everything visual we need to add use a hash:
# do this please

Add them where you want to specify something or whenever you want us to see something that won't appear in the text box.

And if you have a lot of dialogue and want the text box to change mid way through use a new line:
name "a lot of text about something"
name "a second text box worth of stuff"

Example:
# worried
shy girl "no one saw did they?"
# cnt is smug
cnt "everyone saw"
# move back and forward embarrassed
shy girl "why did this have to happen"
cnt "What do you mean why"
cnt "it's your fault"
cnt "it's urgent!" #mocking shy girl quote
cnt "anyway I need to go"
cnt "you might want to put something on"
# cnt walks out
# shy girl changes into school uniform
