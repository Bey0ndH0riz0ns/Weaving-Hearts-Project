Prologue, Scene 1

-Before the Concert

#[mc is seated on a bench in the city’s largest park, gazing into the darkening sky]

"(Some kind of profound monologue regarding his current view of the world, idfk)"

mc  "(I was so lost in thought that I hadn’t noticed how long I had been sitting here, waiting.)"

#[A can of chilled soda appears as the text is read]

mc  "(It was only when I had felt the touch of an ice cold object pressed against the nape of my neck that I realized I had been daydreaming)"

#[Silhouette of Brandon’s sprite appears, as screen shakes to signify mc jolting up]

mc  "?!"

"???"  "Oh, hey, you are awake."
    
#[Pulling out his phone to see the time was now 6:34 PM]

mc  "Yeah, I am. You’re cutting it close. What took you so long?" #[Slightly annoyed tone]

#[Brandon’s silhouette fully becomes the character’s sprite]

bra "Missed the damn train because I had to make a stop. Got us some drinks and snacks, see?" #[Lifts up a convenience store bag full of items]

mc  "(The person that had just risen me from my stupor was my close friend, Brandon Marsh. We’ve known each other since we were kids, but we didn’t really grow up together. I only ever saw him when I would visit my grandparents here in the city, since his house was just down the road.)"

mc  "(You could probably tell from his mannerisms and appearance, but he’s not from Japan. He tells me that when he was 2 years old, his parents were so fascinated by the country that they moved here, though that wasn’t without some issues.)"  

mc  "(Because of this, he was raised by both the Japanese school system and the American mannerisms that his parents carried over from their last residence. The first time I met him, I was 5 years old, and we've become good friends since.)"

#[Standing up from the bench]

mc  "I guess that saves us some money, then. C’mon, the show starts at 7, and we still have to get through the line at security"

bra "Shit, you’re right. Yeah, let’s hurry"

#[mc and Brandon begin walking further through the park to the concert venue, which is a stage set up near the center of the grass]

bra "So what made you a fan of this Scarlett girl? I didn’t think you were the type to follow anything idol related."

mc  "Well, sometime before I moved here, I was scrolling through a bunch of channels. One of them was this broadcast showcasing a bunch of up-and-coming artists. Most of them didn’t really stand out to me. Felt like they were all part of this blur"

#[Looking to the side at mc]

bra "But she did, huh?"

mc  "Yeah… I don’t know what it was about her."

#[mc begins to look up to the sky, in which the sun had already set]

mc  "She just felt so vibrant, you know? Singing those songs all while dancing with a smile. It all just felt… cool, I guess. I don’t know, she just feels right to me, like she just knew how to pique my fancy"

#[Camera cuts back to scene]

bra "And that’s why you wanted to go to the first concert available, to see your new favorite idol live?"

mc  "Yeah, you caught me" #[Mockingly defeated tone]

bra "I thought that was the case. Because I thought you’d wanna see more of Scarlett tonight…"

#[Brandon pulls out 2 tickets from his hoodie pockets, and hands one to mc]

bra "...I got us these"

mc  "No way, are those the deluxe tickets that sold out weeks ago?"

bra "Sure are"

mc  "Don’t these cost quite a bit? I’ll pay you back later, when I can"

#[Waving his hand in front of him dismissively]

bra "Nah, don’t sweat it. Just think of this as a welcome gift from me."

mc  "Oh, well, thanks dude. This is actually a really nice thing of you to do for once"

bra "Like I’m ever not nice" #[Sarcastically]

mc  "Well, it’s a good thing you told me now, because there’s a second line for special ticket holders to go right through"

#[mc points at a shorter, much faster line into the venue with a sign that reads "deluxe patrons only"]

bra "I knew I made the right call to make that stop"

mc  "What was that?" #[Quizzically]

bra "Nothing, let’s head in"

mc  "(The wait had just barely reached the 5 minute mark when we got cleared to enter. It was now 6:50, ten minutes until showtime. And the other line looked like it wouldn’t be fully cleared until after the show had already started. I silently thanked Brandon again for getting these tickets as we headed in)"

#[Scene transitions to the concert]

mc  "(The crowd was unlike anything I had seen before. At least a thousand or two strangers crammed into this small section of the park. There was no ceiling, so you could look up and see the night sky. The stage spotlights were currently aimed at the crowd as one of the sole sources of light for the crowd to see and navigate with. But thanks to our nearly late arrival, Brandon and I were stuck near the rear middle, a good 15 rows away from the stage. But I could thankfully still see the stage clearly, the sea of heads indicative of just how popular Scarlett must be. Before long, the voice of a hypeman roars through the speakers.)"

"Hypeman" "Alright, you precious little Roses. You’ve been waiting long enough. Give some cheer to your darling senpai, Scarlett!"

#[The crowd begins counting down with the hypeman]

"Hypeman" "In 5… 4…. 3… 2… 1…"

mc  "(When the countdown had reached zero, all the lights in the area had shut off. In this period of pitch black respite, a wave of glow sticks from raving fans had emerged, dimly illuminating the restless and excited crowd. When the stage lighting had reactivated, there stood Scarlett, who opened up her performance with her iconic line)"

sca "Heeeeyyyy, everyone~"

#[Sounds of the roaring crowd following this opening line]

sca "How are my lovely little Roses doing on this fine evening? I hope you’re prepared to get pumped up, because the show starts now!"

mc  "(The instrumental of her latest single began to play, as the crowd cheered Scarlett on. The vibrant flashing lights, in conjunction with Scarlett’s stellar singing and captivating rhythmic dances, had created a vivid image that could never be achieved by just viewing a televised broadcast. This was here. This was now. This was Scarlett’s magic spell in action. I stood there in awe, unable to even cheer myself with just how incredible this spectacle was. At least an hour had gone by with this routine keeping my attention in this tunnel visioned daydream. Before I realized, the performance had come to an end and I was left wanting for more. The sounds of encore raging throughout the park awoke me, along with an announcement from Scarlett herself)"

sca "This isn’t the end yet, Roses. You dedicated fans already know that just after this, there will be a meet and greet Q&A panel, where you can request any question of your darling senpai, at the adjacent tent. See you there, lovelies."

#[Scarlett then walks towards the backstage, vanishing behind the curtains]

mc  "(Seemingly reading my mind, I felt Brandon tap my shoulder, speaking to me.)"

bra "That’s us, get your ticket ready"

mc  "Yeah, I have it here. We should head over"

#[mc and Brandon begin to walk over to the exit and towards the neighboring tent]

#[scarlett excited]

sca "I hope everyone has had as much fun as I have!"

"Crowd" "YEAH!!!!"

sca "The meet and greet starts in half an hour, so make sure to stick around!"
    
sca "It's going to be awhile before my next concert, so I'd like to make this count! See you all in a few!"

#[crowd in background, at crowd level]

#[brandon appears mid-screen]

#brandon smug
    
bra "Wow, what a first date, didn’t think it’d be so glamorous."
    
bra "I kinda had a feeling you were excited to see me again, but damn, didn’t think you’d go this far."
    
mc  "Says the one who made us snacks, don’t act like you’re not into it."
    
#[bradon smiling]
    
bra "Into baking sweets and watching you fangirl? Absolutely."

bra "But I will say, Scarlett is pretty sweet."

mc  "Isn’t she? I knew you’d get it."
    
#[brandon slight frown]
    
bra "Oh cool, you’re doing that selective hearing thing again.."
    
mc  "LET’S GO MEET SCARLETT!"

#[mc fades from screen]

bra "Aaaand he’s gone."
    
#[same crowd scene just after transition]

#[scarlett enters mid-screen]

#[scarlett happy]
    
sca "Hi, it’s nice to meet you! As you know, I’m Scarlett! Always awesome to see a new fan!"

mc  "…"

mc  "(DAMMIT! NOW THAT I’M HERE, WHAT DO I SAY!)"

mc  "(OH MY GOD, SHE'S ACTUALLY IN FRONT OF ME!)"
    
"Not Brandon" "(You can take five guys, but not this?)"

mc  "(How the hell does he always do that?)"

#scarlett nervous smile

sca "Soooo, what’s your name?"
    
#brandon enters left side
    
bra "Hey, I’m Brandon and this is #[player given name], sorry he’s weird."

bra "Great show by the way."

#scarlett excited
    
sca "Thank you! I’m glad you liked it! I always try to put on a good show!"

#brandon angry

"..."
    
#brandon shakes MC

#scarlett shocked
    
bra "You were so excited, say something, idiot!"
    
mc  "Right! I-I’m a huge fan, I just wanted to say I’ve been a fan for a long time and your music has helped me a lot!"

mc  "I was hoping you could sign this."

#scarlet hops twice
    
#scarlet happy
    
sca "Absolutely!"
    
#brandon smug
    
bra "Hey, you did it! My boys all grown up!"

mc  "You’re really asking to get put on your ass."

bra "If you're offering."

#brandon smile
    
sca "Here you go! Hope to see you at my next concert!"
    
mc  "I’ll be there!"

-After? the Concert

#[Connor and Brandon exit the concert tent and begin walking towards the end of the line full of deluxe ticket holders, waiting to enter the tent where the Q&A panel would be held]

bra "So what’d you think? Worth the price of the tickets?"

mc  "Yeah, definitely. I’ll be going to the next concert if I find the time. You wanna tag along?"

bra "Sure, I’m down with that."

#[Brandon notices that he has to use the restroom]

bra "Hey, go ahead and get in line without me. Gotta use the restroom real quick."

mc  "Oh, alright. Get back here quick, though. I don’t wanna be in this line alone for too long."

#[Brandon begins heading away from the line, while Connor moves towards it]

#[Connor gazes at how long the line has formed]

mc  "No wonder those tickets sold ou-"

#[Geisha’s silhouette appears, screen shakes]

geiq "He…GYA-!"

mc  "(Since I was distracted by my own thoughts, I didn’t notice that I was about to crash into someone else. I heard her cry out slightly before we were both sent to the ground from our collision)"

#[Scene switches to image of Connor helping Geisha back on her feet]

mc  "Hey, you ok? I wasn’t looking ahead."

geiq "Sorry! My bad, shoulda been, like, watching where I was going…"

mc  "(Oh god, not this trend…)"

mc  "That’s good. Here, lemme help you up."

#[Scene changes to previous backdrop, but Geisha’s sprite is fully visible now]

geiq "Yeah, thanks. Sorry, if I'm, like, making you late somewhere."

mc  "No, it’s fine. I’m just about to get in the line here."

geiq "You’re here for the panel? Like, no way! How did you even manage to buy the tickets? They sold out in, like, 30 seconds."

mc  "Oh, that was thanks to my friend. I don't know where he got them, but we came here together."

geiq "Tsk… fuckin’ lucky…"

mc  "What, did you not manage to get them?"

geiq "No… just barely had enough to, like, get the basic one…"

mc  "Well, that’s too bad, I gue-"

#[Nekome’s sprite rushes into the scene, out of breath]

nekq "Kiriiiin~! Wait up~!"

mc  "(Kirin…?)"

krn "Oh hii~, Nyeko-chan. What’s up?"

nyk "Why’d you run off like that?" #[Pouty-like]

krn "I just felt like getting out of here, ya know?"

nyk "But Kirin, Atsuko managed to, like, upgrade our tickets. I wanted to tell you, but you, like, ran off and stuff." #[Excitedly]

krn "She did? Like, how??"
    
nyk "I don't know, but she told me to come get you and bring you back."
    
krn "Like, where is she then?!"
    
nyk "She should be near the front now, so we should like-"
    
#[Geisha’s sprite rushes off (with a sound like they use in cartoons, you know the kind)]

nyk "Heyy~! Don’t do that~"

#[Nekome turns to Connor, giving him a quick silent glance, before her sprites also rushes off, but slower than Geisha]

mc  "(Wonder what her deal is. Still, glad that girl’s problem got solved.)"

#[Connor begins walking to the end of the line, and starts waiting his turn. Brandon soon returns]

bra "Yo, I miss anything?"

mc  "Nah, you’re fine. Just ran into this group of gals. Nothing really happened though."

bra "Ok, then. Let’s get in there."

mc  "(Kirin, huh? I think I know that name. I’ll have to check if it really was them…)"

#[The scene transitions into the tent]

mc  "(Brandon and I take our seats. I can’t get a good look to see where that Kirin girl and her friends are, but that’s fine.)"

#[Scarlett’s sprite appears]

mc  "(The panel began, but the questions were lackluster for the most part, usually just about Scarlett’s sizes, her address… things she would never even want to answer. It continued like this until a reporter stood up and posed a rather odd question that received an even more outstanding answer.)"
    
"Reporter" "Rumor has it that you’re still in highschool, Ms. Scarlett, but you’re set to graduate this year. Is this a claim that you can confirm, and what would it mean for your career going forward?"
    
#[Scarlett’s sprite takes on somewhat of a strained smile]
    
sca "Oh, wow~! You must know your stuff, huh…?"

#[Sprite returns to normal]

sca "Well, I’ll have you know that I definitely have big plans coming up by the end of the year. Because, and you heard this here first, my little roses, I’m planning on taking on the idol industry in Japan by storm, and rising to the top!"

#[The crowd cheers]
    
sca "And not only that, when I’m done with Japan, I’m going after the world itself! I hope you’ll be there to support your darling Senpai."

#[Scarlett’s sprite puts on a cute face]

sca "Won’t you?"

#[Crowd cheers even louder than before]

mc  "(She’s really planning on doing all that? Well, damn, I’ll be on that wild ride too.)"

mc  "(...but wait, what about the first part? She didn’t outright deny it. It’s more like she… tried to avoid it. Whatever the case, I’ll try my best to show her my support.)"

#[Scene fades to black]

mc  "(The panel continued on with nothing else special happening. After a series of answered questions, Scarlett thanked everyone for coming, and she retired backstage while the crowd dispersed towards the exit. After we left the venue, Brandon and I walked back to the train station. On the train, I told Brandon what I thought of her avoiding the question, and he replied that it’s just her business and she doesn’t have to tell anybody. After we got off the train, we walked down to our houses, said our good nights, and turned in for some sleep.)"
